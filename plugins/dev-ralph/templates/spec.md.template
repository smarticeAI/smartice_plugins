## Verification Checklist

Define success before implementation. These bash commands should return 0 when the feature is properly integrated.

```bash
# File existence verification
test -f src/services/new_service.ts

# Import verification - check new module is imported in entry point
grep -q "from.*new_service" src/main.ts

# Registration verification - check new component is registered
grep -q "app.register.*NewService" src/app.ts

# Integration verification - check new code is wired into existing system
grep -n "newFunction" src/index.ts | grep -q "."

# Test file exists
test -f src/services/__tests__/new_service.test.ts
```

**Common patterns by framework:**

```bash
# Node.js/Express - route registration
grep -q "router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)" src/routes/new_route.ts

# Python/FastAPI - endpoint registration
grep -q "@app\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)" src/app_fastapi.py

# React - component export and usage
grep -q "export.*NewComponent" src/components/NewComponent.tsx
grep -q "<NewComponent" src/App.tsx

# Go - handler registration
grep -q "HandleFunc.*newHandler" cmd/server/main.go
```
