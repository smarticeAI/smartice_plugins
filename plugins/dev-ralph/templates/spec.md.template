## Technical Contract

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Example {
  id: number
  name: string
  createdAt: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// Create
POST /examples
  Body: { name: string }
  Response: Example
  Errors: 400 (validation)

// Read
GET /examples
  Query: ?filter=value&limit=10
  Response: { items: Example[] }

GET /examples/:id
  Response: Example
  Errors: 404 (not found)

// Update
PATCH /examples/:id
  Body: { name?: string }
  Response: Example
  Errors: 404 (not found)

// Delete
DELETE /examples/:id
  Response: { success: true }
  Errors: 404 (not found)
```

## Requirements

### Functional

1. [Requirement 1 - what the system must do]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

### Non-Functional

- **Performance**: [e.g., API responds within 100ms]
- **Persistence**: [e.g., Data survives server restart]
- **Validation**: [e.g., All inputs validated before processing]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Empty required field | 400 with validation message |
| Resource not found | 404 with "not found" message |
| Invalid data type | 400 with type error message |
| [Other edge case] | [Behavior] |

## Out of Scope

Explicitly list what is NOT part of this feature:

- [Feature X - will be added later]
- [Feature Y - out of scope for this project]

## Dependencies

- `stdlib/errors` - Error handling utilities
- `stdlib/validation` - Input validation schemas
- [Other dependencies]

---

## Success Criteria

How do we know this feature is complete?

- [ ] All endpoints return correct response shapes
- [ ] Validation errors return helpful messages
- [ ] Data persists correctly
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Type-check passes
