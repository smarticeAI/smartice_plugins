# Lessons Learned

This file accumulates discoveries across iterations. Read at start of each iteration.

---

## How to Use This File

- **Read at start of each iteration** - Build on previous learnings
- **Update after each item** - Main Claude adds entries
- **Track error counts** - Use `**[N]**` prefix for repeated errors
- **Sign promotion** - When error count reaches 3, add Sign to PROMPT.md

---

## Error Patterns (Track Counts!)

<!--
Format: **[COUNT]** Error description → Fix

CRITICAL: Increment COUNT each time this error recurs.
When COUNT >= 3, Main Claude MUST add this as a Sign in PROMPT.md.

Example:
**[1]** Forgot to register routes → Add route registration to checklist
**[2]** Forgot to register routes → Same issue, need Sign if it happens again
**[3]** Forgot to register routes → PROMOTED TO SIGN in PROMPT.md

## What Worked

<!--
Successful patterns to replicate.
Format: - Pattern description (iteration N)

Example:
- Using Result<T, E> type for error handling (iteration 3)
- Barrel exports in index.ts for clean imports (iteration 5)
-->

---

## Discovered Requirements

<!--
Requirements not in original spec that we discovered.
Format: - Discovery (iteration N)

Example:
- API requires auth header even for public endpoints (iteration 2)
- Database has 255 char limit on username (iteration 4)
-->

## Iteration Log

<!--
Brief outcome of each iteration.
Format: Iteration N: [PASS/FAIL] Brief description
-->

## stdlib Proposals

<!--
When a pattern proves useful 3+ times, propose for stdlib.
Format:

### Proposed: pattern-name.md
Observed N times. Code:
```
