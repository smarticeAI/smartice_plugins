# Lessons Learned

This file accumulates discoveries across Ralph loops. Read at start of each iteration to avoid repeating mistakes and build on what worked.

## How to Use This File

- **Read at start of each iteration** - Context in PROMPT.md directs you here
- **Append after verification** - Verification auditor adds entries
- **Don't delete entries** - This is a running log, not a single-use report
- **Use anchors** - Reference specific patterns with `#section-name`

### Discovered Requirements
<!-- Requirements not in original spec that we had to address -->
<!-- Format: - [iteration N] Description of what we discovered was needed -->

### Error Patterns
<!-- Repeated mistakes and their fixes -->
<!-- Format: - [iteration N] Error → Fix: Description -->

### What Worked
<!-- Patterns that accelerated development -->
<!-- Format: - [iteration N] Pattern that worked well -->

### Anti-Patterns Found
<!-- Things to avoid in future iterations -->
<!-- Format: - [iteration N] What NOT to do: Description -->

## Pattern Library Proposals

<!-- When an error pattern repeats 3+ times, propose adding to stdlib/ -->
<!-- Format:
### Proposed: pattern-name.md

Pattern observed N times. Propose adding to `.ralph/stdlib/`:
