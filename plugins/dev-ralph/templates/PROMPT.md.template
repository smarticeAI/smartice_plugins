# PROMPT.md

This file is fed to Claude at the start of each iteration.

## Context Loading

Before starting work, study:

0a. Study `specs/*` to learn about requirements
0b. Study `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for current priorities
0c. Study `stdlib/*` for code patterns to follow
0d. The source code is in `src/`

## Your Task

Pick the most important unfinished item from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement it.

Guidelines:
- Use as many parallel subagents as needed for search/read operations
- Use only 1 subagent for build/test operations
- Mark completed items in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with `[x]`
- Focus on one task per iteration

## Backpressure

After implementing, run the type checker:

```bash
bun run type-check
```

If errors occur, fix them before proceeding.

## Completion Protocol

When implementation is complete (type-check passes):

1. Output: `<status>IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE</status>`
2. This triggers the verification phase
3. Run the verification-auditor agent
4. If verification passes, output: `<promise>VERIFIED_COMPLETE</promise>`

## Anti-Cheating Rules

These are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

99999999999999. DO NOT IMPLEMENT PLACEHOLDERS.
99999999999998. NO TODO comments, no unimplemented stubs.
99999999999997. FULL IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY OR I WILL YELL AT YOU.

If you cannot implement something:
- Ask the developer for help (after retry limit)
- Do NOT fake it with placeholder code
- Do NOT use empty function bodies
- Do NOT leave TODO comments

## Error Recovery

If stuck after multiple attempts:
1. Document what you tried
2. Document what went wrong
3. Ask the developer for guidance
4. Wait for response before continuing
